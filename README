Indent

Indent is a writer's planning tool for creating anything from universes to characters, to plots, to individual items.

It is also meant to expand into many areas to benefit writers, including areas like:
- Automated revision services
- Structuring real-time natural language processing output into a reusable state
- Decision-making algorithms for improving reading comprehension, reading level, accent-correction, and other real-
 time writing suggestions
- A knowledge graph of structured data in your universe, and an engine to manipulate it in awesome ways
- Machine learning on generating character and location names, suggesting realistic defaults (random or not), and more
- and tons more

If you are interested in helping out, check out the issue tracker. I've loaded it with tons of action-based, chunk-sized
improvements that I think anyone familiar with Rails will be able to jump in and complete. Feel free to make suggestions,
open issues, join discussions, or ask where you should look in the code to get started implementing something. :)

There are a ton of milestones that comprise a massive amount of feature creep, but represent the areas I see Indent
moving into and benefiting writers, designers, programmers, and many others greatly! They have no timelines and are all
in development simultaneously; feel free to jump around to wherever interests you most. They are split into completely
independent milestones that do not affect each either, so whichever ones the developers want to work on first will be
completed first.
